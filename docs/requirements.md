Qualification Requirements

    The project should use MetaMask Smart Accounts. MetaMask Smart Accounts are signer agnostic, so you can use any wallet provider of your choice i.e. MetaMask extension, MetaMask Embedded Wallets, Dynamic or Privy.

    The project should be deployed on the Monad testnet. If opting for the cross chain track, it should be Monad testnet + any other chain.

    To integrate MetaMask Smart Accounts use the Delegation Toolkit SDK.

    The project demo video should have a working MetaMask Smart Accounts integration on Monad depicted in the main flow of the application.

    The judges can decide not to reward a track prize if no project meets the standards set by them internally, apart from the basic submission criteria.


    Envio Bonus requirements

To qualify for the Envio bounty, projects must demonstrably use Envio's infrastructure (e.g. HyperIndex or HyperSync) as a core part of their submission. It could be powering an indexer, enabling notifications, structuring data pipelines, or any other creative integration. Sufficient evidence of Envio usage includes, but is not limited to:

‚Ä¢ A working indexer using Envio.

‚Ä¢ Query and usage of HyperSync's API

‚Ä¢ Queries or endpoints generated by Envio being consumed in the project.

‚Ä¢ Documentation, code, or demos that show Envio actively supporting the project's functionality.


Best AI agent

Judging Criteria

Build an AI agent that leverages delegations to act on behalf of users on Monad.

MetaMask Smart Accounts simplify the process by abstracting away complexity, making it seamless for users to grant permissions and enable the agent to act on their behalf.

Possible Directions

    Build an agent to provide better yield.

    Build an agent for DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging).

        References: 1shot API

    Build an agent for portfolio management.
